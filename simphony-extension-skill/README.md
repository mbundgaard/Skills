# Simphony Extension Development Skill

Production-validated patterns and templates for developing Oracle Simphony Extension Applications.

## What This Skill Does

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for building Oracle Simphony Extension Applications (POS integration plugins). It includes production-validated patterns, copy-paste ready code templates, and best practices for developing C#/.NET extensions that integrate with Oracle Simphony POS systems.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need help with:

- Creating new Simphony Extension Applications from scratch
- Implementing POS integrations (payments, loyalty, inventory, etc.)
- Following Simphony development best practices
- Troubleshooting deployment and runtime issues
- Choosing appropriate architectural patterns based on project complexity

## What's Included

### Universal Mandatory Patterns
15 core patterns required in every extension, including project structure, dependency injection, logging framework, configuration management, and script implementation.

### Copy-Paste Ready Templates
20 template files covering everything from project setup to specific implementations (OpsContext, Configuration, Scripts, Logging, Helpers, etc.).

### Domain-Specific Patterns
Implementation guides for common scenarios:
- Simple posting operations (dispensing, inventory)
- Complex multi-domain operations
- Loyalty and customer management
- Data export and processing
- Background services and hosted applications
- Time-keeping and compliance

### Scale-Appropriate Guidance
Different patterns for different project sizes:
- **Simple** (2-5 scripts): Minimal configuration, direct posting
- **Medium** (5-15 scripts): Event handlers, background services
- **Complex** (15+ scripts): Workflow coordination, multi-domain orchestration

## Getting Started

Simply ask Claude for help with your Simphony Extension Application development. Claude will use this skill to provide production-validated guidance and code based on your specific needs.

**Examples:**
- "Help me create a new Simphony Extension for loyalty points"
- "I need to implement a simple dispense posting operation"
- "My extension isn't loading in Simphony, help me troubleshoot"
