# Enterprise Development Skills

A curated collection of production-validated development patterns, templates, and specialized knowledge for enterprise software development.

## Overview

This repository contains **Claude Skills** - specialized knowledge packages that transform Claude from a general-purpose AI into a domain expert equipped with real-world, battle-tested development patterns.

Each skill is built from analysis of production codebases and validated across multiple enterprise projects, providing developers with proven patterns rather than theoretical approaches.

## Available Skills

### Enterprise Integration
- **[Simphony Extension Application Development](./simphony-extension-development/)** - Comprehensive patterns for Oracle Simphony POS integration development based on analysis of 6 production projects (721 C# files)

### Coming Soon
- **API Integration Patterns** - RESTful service integration best practices
- **Enterprise Database Design** - Scalable data architecture patterns
- **Microservices Communication** - Inter-service messaging and orchestration
